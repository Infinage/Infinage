# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m **Naresh Jagadeesan**, and I hope youâ€™re having a great day! Nice to e-meet you.  

## About Me  
Iâ€™m an experienced Python developer whoâ€™s currently flirting with C++ to see if sheâ€™s **the one**. My GitHub is a mix of projects Iâ€™ve tinkered with, experiments Iâ€™ve run, and ideas Iâ€™ve tried to bring to life.

If you have suggestions to improve my code or are excited about collaborating, Iâ€™d love to hear from you!

## Projects  

### **JSON Parser**  
[Repository Link](https://github.com/Infinage/cpp-experiments/tree/main/json-parser)  
A lightweight, header-only JSON library in C++ (`json.hpp`) that lets you parse, create, and validate JSON documents.

### **Redis Server Clone**  
[Repository Link](https://github.com/Infinage/cpp-experiments/tree/main/redis-server)  
A lightweight Redis server clone built in C++. Single threaded & uses raw sockets, how challenging could that be?

### **Age Prediction Using TensorFlow and OpenCV**  
[Repository Link](https://github.com/Infinage/Age-Prediction)  
A machine learning project exploring the end-to-end lifecycle of building, training, and deploying models. The predictions arenâ€™t perfect, but the pipeline works great!  

### **FingerNet**  
[Repository Link](https://github.com/Infinage/FingerNet)  
Built back in the day I was all gung-ho on deep learning. Machine learning models require a ton of data to reach good performance. How well can a model learn to classify with just a single training data sample?

### **Maze Generator & Solver**  
[Repository Link](https://github.com/Infinage/maze)  
Mazes sounded fun, how about a nice game on the CLI? Implemented 5 generator algorithms (Wilson, Kruskal, Prim, Ellers, Backtracking) & 3 (Dijkstra, A\*, Dead end filling) solver algorithms.

### **Ecom Trading**  
[Repository Link](https://github.com/Infinage/ecom-trading)  
I once had a thing for web development, Javascript was this crazy party going gal that I couldn\'t simply resist. This is your average ecommerce website where you can both buy and sell your goods.

### **DSA**
[Repository Link](https://github.com/Infinage/DSA)  
A DSA problem a day keeps unemployment away. Warning: I make a ton of commits here daily. Please donâ€™t watch this repository unless you chill about getting spammed.
