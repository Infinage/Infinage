## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Naresh here. I hope you are having a great day! It was nice to e-meet you.

*About me:* The repositories you find are some of the work that I have experimented, played with & tinkered along the way. I've dabbled my hands with Data science and recently shifted my focus towards Web development. If you know of ways to improve on my code or if the idea of collaborating with me excites you, please reach me out!

#### My Recent Projects:
* [Om Shakthi Constructions](https://om-shakthi-constructions.cyclic.app/): A sample constructions portfolio website built with React JS / Node.
* [ECom Trading](https://ecom-trading.cyclic.app/): An ecommerce website built with React & Node.
* [IPL Dashboard](https://ipl-dashboard.cyclic.app/): Inspired by Java Brains, branched out from using a Java backend to Node. One of my first projects with the Node/React Stack.
